Plurality notes that not everyone is a point; some are trees, others diamonds, and that the goal is thus not sphere-packing but arranging the space so as to allow maximum flexibility for regions of space to themselves pack more complex objects and and even more richly to allow space for sub-spaces, etc.  This analogy is missing from the \"Rights, Operating Systems and Digital Freedom\" chapter and should be added somewhere.","labels":["gov4git:pmp-v1"],"frozen":false,"closed":false,"cancelled":false,"archived":false,"score":{"attention":249},"ref_by":null,"ref_to":null}
