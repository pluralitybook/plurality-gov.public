I tried writing a manuscript tailored to Japan.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nJapan is currently in the midst of unprecedented social change. With the declining birthrate and aging population, labor shortage has become a serious problem. This has led to growing expectations for automation technologies such as AI and robotics. The efficiency and productivity improvements brought about by these technologies are essential for Japan's future economy.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the current social structure where the elderly make up a large proportion of the population, democratically elected politicians tend to prioritize the welfare of the elderly over the needs of the working-age population. Perhaps due to the generational conflict of interest between the future benefits of investing in science and technology and the current benefits of elderly welfare, there is a growing sense of disappointment in democracy, particularly among the younger generation, leading to a decline in voter turnout. In order for technological innovation to bring happiness to everyone in society, careful deliberation from the perspectives of all people is necessary on how to apply technology.\r\n\r\nThis book focuses on the intersection of technology and democracy in this situation, exploring how balanced progress can be achieved. Along with concrete examples from around the world, it discusses how technology can foster cooperation in society. Through this dialogue, readers will gain insights into the roles they should play in both the current and future Japanese society.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI welcome any comments!","labels":["gov4git:pmp-v1"],"frozen":false,"closed":false,"cancelled":false,"archived":false,"score":{"attention":14400},"ref_by":null,"ref_to":null}
