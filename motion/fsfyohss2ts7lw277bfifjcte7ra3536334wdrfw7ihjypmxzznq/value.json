This belongs either in Chapter 5-4 (where many of the tools he used are) or in 5-3 given that his approach was even more immersive and sensorially immersive than most of the techniques in 5-4 are.  I would even support this being given as the motivating example in 5-3.  @nishio please consider writing this together with some of your colleagues.","labels":["gov4git:pmp-v1"],"frozen":false,"closed":false,"cancelled":false,"archived":false,"score":{"attention":22500},"ref_by":null,"ref_to":null}
