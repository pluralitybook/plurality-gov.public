There is a place at the end of the chapter where this should be filled in, in a case study of about 1 page/2-3 paragraphs.  Ideally it should be tied to the history in the chapter, including to Henry George, given the heavy use of land taxes in Estonia, though primary focus should be on the role of technology.","labels":["gov4git:pmp-v1"],"frozen":false,"closed":false,"cancelled":false,"archived":false,"score":{"attention":0},"ref_by":null,"ref_to":null}
