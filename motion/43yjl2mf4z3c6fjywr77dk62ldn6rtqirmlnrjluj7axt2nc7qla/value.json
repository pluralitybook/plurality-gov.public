I came up with an idea for creating a glossary, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on it.\r\n\r\nWe already have a list of 1800+ keywords for the index, which was created by the community and reviewed by several people, including Glen. This list can be interpreted as a list of important concepts discussed in the book. Additionally, we have a script that identifies where these keywords appear in the text for index creation.\r\n\r\nSo, theoretically, we are able to extract mentions of each of these keywords from the book and pass them to LLM to generate explanations. I'd like to explore this direction.\r\n\r\nInitially, it would be in English, but I believe this glossary should also be multilingual. Additionally, adding new entries should be possible.\r\n\r\nImproving the descriptions, translations, and adding new entries to this glossary would provide a more easy way of contributing to the project compared to adding content to the main text. It would create opportunities for active participation for many people around the world.\r\n\r\nGlenWeyl\r\nLove this idea!!","labels":["gov4git:pmp-v1"],"frozen":false,"closed":false,"cancelled":false,"archived":false,"score":{"attention":90000},"ref_by":null,"ref_to":null}
