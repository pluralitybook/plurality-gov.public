Its limitations should also be discussed - excessive personalization of subjective reality could lead to isolation.\r\nDetails: https://blu3mo.com/Thoughts-about-Plurality-and-Immersive-Technology-(WIP)\r\n\u003e The article explores how immersive technology aligns with the concept of plurality, where reality is subjective and intersubjective, and can be intentionally designed to create personalized experiences while maintaining a shared reality. By thoughtfully designing asymmetry in various aspects such as language, nonverbal cues, space, and time, immersive technology can foster collaboration across differences and promote empathy and understanding, while avoiding the pitfalls of isolated filter bubbles.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of making radical edits and seeing what would get accepted and what wouldn't. I'm looking forward to receiving critical feedback.\r\n(I guess controversial changes would be an interesting case to test PMP anyway)","labels":["gov4git:pmp-v1"],"frozen":false,"closed":false,"cancelled":false,"archived":false,"score":{"attention":1600},"ref_by":null,"ref_to":null}
