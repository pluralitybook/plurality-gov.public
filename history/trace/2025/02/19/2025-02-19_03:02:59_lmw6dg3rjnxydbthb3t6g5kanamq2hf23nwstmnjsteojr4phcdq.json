A real eye opener for me. This offer of a correction is intended as a contribution, not a criticism. I just happen to know a fair bit about George ðŸ˜† \r\n\r\nThe claim that Henry George was 'a searing critic of private property' jumped out at me as factually incorrect and misleading.\r\n\r\nI have simply added two words ('...in land') that correct the error without, in my view, drawing attention to it nor distracting from the broader point being made.\r\n\r\nI quote from Progress and Poverty (1879):\r\n\r\n'[T]here is a clear and indisputable title to everything produced by human exertion. It descends from the original producer, in whom it is vested by natural laws.'\r\n\r\nThis quote shows us that George was a strong advocate for the institution of private property. However, it is strictly qualified. It is from P\u0026P, Book VII, Chapter 1: [The Injustice of Private Property in Land](https://www.henrygeorge.org/pchp26.htm ), where even the chapter title tells us what he was 'a searing critic of'. And his justification is thus:\r\n\r\n'It is production that gives the producer the right to exclusive possession and enjoyment. If so, there can be no right to exclusive possession of anything that is not the product of labor. Therefore, private property in land is wrong.'\r\n\r\nAgain, tying the two together (indisputable title to the things we make v. no right to private property in land):\r\n\r\n'The right to the product of labor cannot be enjoyed without the right to free use of the opportunities offered by nature. To admit a right in property nature is to deny the right of property as the product of labor.'\r\n\r\n","labels":["gov4git:pmp-v1"],"frozen":false,"closed":true,"cancelled":false,"archived":false,"score":{"attention":0},"ref_by":null,"ref_to":null}}}}
