I know it is an evolving project and that things will be added over time, but having an audiobook version of the core chapters would be really nice and add another layer of accessibility and onramps for folks who might want to dip their toe into the ⿻ space on their daily commute or dog walk!\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be ideal, but the ElevenLabs text-to-speech AI is pretty good these days, although there are tons of options. I don't think it would cost that much to get a fairly professional-sounding version out there across different platforms.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as someone who is in the car a lot, I'd love to see this come to fruition!\r\n\r\n#263 ","labels":["gov4git:pmp-v1"],"frozen":false,"closed":false,"cancelled":false,"archived":false,"score":{"attention":1038361},"ref_by":null,"ref_to":null}
