Because IIRC '[capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism)' refers to a _specific type_ of market-based economy where most capital is privately owned, but other economic models that still retain the market mechanism do exist (eg. [market socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism)). So making the implicit assumption that 'market-based economy' necessarily equals 'capitalism' could be misleading.\r\n\r\n(disclaimer: I am not an economist.)","labels":["gov4git:pmp-v1"],"frozen":false,"closed":true,"cancelled":false,"archived":false,"score":{"attention":-5},"ref_by":null,"ref_to":null}}}}
