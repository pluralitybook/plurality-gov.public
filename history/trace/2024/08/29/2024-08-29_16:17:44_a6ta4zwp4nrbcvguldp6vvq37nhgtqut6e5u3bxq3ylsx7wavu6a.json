A more powerful framing has been more balanced, focused on the divide between those who create technology and those to whom \"it happens\", emphasizing yes the lack of democracy and traditional inclusion issues, but also issues around religion (and the extreme secularism of the tech world) and colonialism.  It would be good to adjust the framing to address these perspectives.","labels":["gov4git:pmp-v1"],"frozen":false,"closed":false,"cancelled":false,"archived":false,"score":{"attention":0},"ref_by":null,"ref_to":null}}}}
